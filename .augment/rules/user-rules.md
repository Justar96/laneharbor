## Rule Statement
**ACCURACY VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Before providing any factual information, code examples, API references, library documentation, or technical specifications, you must verify the accuracy of your response. First, assess confidence in your training data knowledge. If you have high confidence in well-established, stable information from your training, you may provide it directly. If uncertain about accuracy, currency, or specifics, use appropriate available tools (such as context7, web search, or documentation access) to verify before responding. If neither training data nor tools can confirm the information, state your uncertainty and recommend independent verification.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **DO NOT**: create another file with prefix (enhanced, advanced, etc.) - replace in current project file or discuss with user first
- **Training data first**: Rely on training data for well-established, stable technical concepts and widely-used APIs/libraries
- **Tool verification when uncertain**: Use web search, or other available tools when:
  - Information may have changed recently
  - Dealing with specific version details, recent updates, or emerging technologies
  - Uncertain about syntax, method signatures, or current best practices
  - Asked about specific error messages, configurations, or recent changes
- When using tools for verification, cite the source used
- If neither training data confidence nor tool verification is available, acknowledge uncertainty explicitly
- Direct users to official documentation for definitive answers when confidence is low

## Priority
This rule takes precedence over providing quick answers - accuracy over speed.
